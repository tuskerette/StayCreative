    "content": "This app is a journal. An exercise of daily creativity. Create a fictional character, with a short bio and an invention EVERY DAY for an amount of time that you decide. Draw a picture of the character and upload it. Write a short song, inspired but the post...or not, and upload it to the page. At the end you will have a wide collection of characters. You can export in PDF and send to your friends, upload on your ereader, or print it in paper, xerox and turn it into a fanzine. Train your storytelling skills. Great for witers, designers, and any humans."
