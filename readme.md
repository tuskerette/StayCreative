It is a journal and a diary. An exercise of daily creativity.
Train your storytelling skills. Great for writers, designers, and any humans.
Create a fictional character, with a short bio and an invention every day for an amount of time that you decide.
Draw a picture of the character or take a picture of someone who represents and looks exactly like your character and upload it.
At the end you will have a wide and fun collection of characters.
You can export the posts in PDF and send the file to your friends, upload it on your e-reader, or even print it in paper, xerox it and turn it into a fanzine.
