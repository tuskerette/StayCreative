### Developed by Valeria Graffeo, [tuskerette](http://www.tuskerette.com).

### July 2015 Version 0.1.0


### Link
The app is visible [here](https://staycreative.herokuapp.com/).
It is hosted on Heroku, please be patient the first time you load the app.


### About the app
It is a journal and a diary. An exercise of daily creativity.
Train your storytelling skills. Great for writers, designers, and any humans.

Create a fictional character, with a short bio and an invention every day for an amount of time that you decide.

Draw a picture of the character or take a picture of someone who represents and looks exactly like your character and upload it.

At the end you will have a wide and fun collection of characters.


### Future development
You will be able to export the posts in PDF and send the file to your friends, upload it on your e-reader, or even print it in paper, xerox it and turn it into a fanzine.
(partially implemented in the banch pdf)
