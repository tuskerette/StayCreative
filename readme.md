Train your storytelling skills.
Great for writers, designers, and any humans.
An exercise of daily creativity.
Create a fictional character, with a short bio and an invention EVERY DAY for an amount of time that you decide (7 days, 15 days, 1 month, 100 days or a year.)
Draw a picture of the character or take a picture of someone who represents and looks exatly like your character and upload it.
